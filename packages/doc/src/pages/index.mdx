# job orders

Asynchronous job queuing and execution tracking system.

## Features

### Job orders dispatch and execution tracking

- Dispatch background jobs to dedicated microservices
- Job Submission: job orders allows clients to submit jobs for asynchronous processing.
- Job Management: job orders provides an interface for monitoring the progress of jobs and retrieving the results when they are completed.
- Job Prioritization: job orders allows for jobs to be prioritized based on their importance or urgency.
- Track job execution status

### Integrity

- Ensure that each job order is processed at least once and successfully so at most once (unless cancelled or expired).

### Execution control

- Schedule execution.
- Cancel, reschedule job orders.
- Set a validity expiration date.
- Automatic Retry: job orders provides automatic retry functionality for failed jobs, with configurable retry policies and backoff strategies.
- Dead Letter Queue: job orders can route failed jobs to a dead letter queue, allowing for manual inspection and debugging of failed jobs.

### Error recovery

- Recover from microservices errors, replay job orders
- Error Handling: job orders provides configurable error handling mechanisms to manage job failures and retries.
- Graceful Degradation: job orders can gracefully degrade functionality when dependent microservices are unavailable, allowing other jobs to continue processing.

### Observability

- Monitor background job activity
- Real-Time Monitoring: job orders provides real-time monitoring of job progress, allowing clients to view updates on job status as they occur.
- Reporting: job orders provides reporting and analytics features, allowing clients to track job performance and identify areas for optimization.
- Error Logging: job orders can log errors and exceptions for debugging purposes, providing insights into the root cause of job failures.

### Security

- Security: job orders provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can submit and monitor jobs.
- Circuit Breaking: job orders can implement circuit breaking patterns to detect and handle failures in downstream microservices, preventing cascading failures.

### Integration

- job orders makes no assumption on the technology used to execute jobs, instead it provides a protocol for job execution tracking that can be easily integrated on your current codebase.
- Customization: job orders is highly customizable, allowing for configuration of parameters such as timeout durations, retry limits, and worker node capacity.

### Scalability

- Scalability: job orders is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for multiple worker nodes to process jobs in parallel.
- Load Balancing: job orders can implement load balancing techniques to distribute job processing across multiple worker nodes, improving fault tolerance and scalability.
- Health Checks: job orders can implement health checks to monitor the availability and performance of worker nodes, ensuring that only healthy nodes are used for job processing.
